**Lexical Analyzer and Syntax Parser**

- **Project Overview**: Developed a Lexical Analyzer and Syntax Parser to process and analyze programming language code, identifying tokens and checking for syntactical correctness.
- **Technologies Used**: Implemented using C++ with standard libraries for input/output operations, data handling, and file management.
- **Objective**: Designed to simulate compiler front-end operations, enhancing understanding of lexical analysis and syntax parsing in compiler design.
- **Key Features**:
  
  - **Tokenization**: Identifies and categorizes various elements such as reserved words, identifiers, numbers, operators, delimiters, and data types.
  - **Syntax Analysis**: Validates the structure of conditional statements, ensuring correct syntax and proper bracket closures.
  - **File Handling**: Reads code input from a text file and processes it for analysis.
  - **Error Handling**: Detects and reports syntax errors, such as missing conditions or incorrect bracket closures.
  - **User Feedback**: Outputs the lexemes and their corresponding token types, along with any syntax errors encountered.
